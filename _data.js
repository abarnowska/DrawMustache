		title: "Self Portrait With Palette",
		author: "Pablo Picasso",
		description:
			"The tough, spare Self-Portrait with a Palette which Picasso painted in Paris in the autumn of 1906 makes a fitting partner to his Portrait of Gertrude Stein and uses allusion in a similar way. This time he seems not to have had much difficulty, and the picture was painted confidently and without major revisions. As if to underline his sense of brotherhood with her, Picasso gave himself the same mask-like, Iberian-style features and hypnotized gaze, and emphasized the mass and strength of his body.",

		title: "Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird",
		author: "Frida Kahlo",
		description:
			"Painted by Frida Kahlo in 1940. Although this painting has a small size (about 16x24), it draws lots of interest since it contains so many aspects that are symbolic of Frida Kahlo. One of them is a hummingbird hanging on the thorn, which knots around her throat. Her expression is calm and solemn. It also seems she is patiently enduring the pain. She was not painting a realistic scene but using these symbolic elements to express her feelings. A bird often symbolizes freedom and life. Especially a hummingbird, which is colorful and always hovering above flowers. But in this painting, the hummingbird is black and lifeless. This might be a symbol of Frida herself. Frida spent most of her life in physical pain after the bus accident when she was eighteen. After that, she endured about 35 operations to fix her body. This is a painting about her suffering.",
