                        Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) was a French painter and sculptor whose work is associated with
                        Cubism, Dada, and conceptual art. He has had an immense impact on 20th- and 21st-century
                        art, and a seminal influence on the development of
                        conceptual art.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One of his best-known pieces of art is "L.H.O.O.Q." based on a cheap postcard reproduction
                        of Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" onto which Duchamp drew a mustache and beard in pencil
                        and appended the title.
