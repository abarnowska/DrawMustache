 # Draw Mustache 


> Java Script application to have fun and learning art history. Inspirated by french artist Marcel Duchamp, who created "L.H.O.O.Q." based on a cheap postcard reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" onto which Duchamp drew a mustache and beard in pencil and appended the title.
